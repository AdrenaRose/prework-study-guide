            The head element contains information about the webpage. This

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS = Cascading Style Sheets</li>
          <li>
            Defines colors, aesthestics, visual layout, and organization of a
            webpage
          </li>
          <li>
            Inline CSS is used when a developer wants to style an element
            directly in the HTML file
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>Useful for quick and permanent changes</li>
            <li>
              Applied to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS
              rule
            </li>
            <li>
              Each inline style must be edited individually whenever there is a
              design change
            </li>
            <li>Example: [h1 style="color:red;"] Prework Study Guide[/h1]</li>

          <li>Internal CSS style sheet</li>
          <ul>
            <li>CSS style sheet embedded directly in the HTML file</li>
            <li>Use a [style] element in the [head] element</li>
            <li>Rules apply to that page only</li>
            <li>
              Classes and ids are used to identify elements and style multiple
              elements in the page code
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>External CSS style sheet</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Most common way to style a webpage</li>
            <li>
              Preferred because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules
              in a separate file, making design changes easier
            </li>
            <li>
              To use, the external style sheet is linked in the HTML's head

          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Selector defines the element or attributes to which the
              declarations will apply
            </li>
            <li>
              Declarations contain the CSS property we want to apply and the
              value of that property
            </li>
            <li>
              Two or more declarations in a row is called a declaration block
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            The margin property dictates how much space we want around the
            *outside* of an element.
          </li>
          <li>
            The padding property adds space around the content *inside* an
            element. If padding is increased, the size of the entire element is
            increased.
          </li>
          <li>Consider every HTML element like a box</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              CSS box model - each box (element) consists of margins outside the
              element, and the element's borders, padding, and content.
            </li>
            <li>Content, padding, and border are *inside* the element.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            The * (wild card symbol) can be used as a selector to apply a rule
            to ALL elements on a page.
          </li>
          <li>
            Two selectors can be combined into a single CSS rule with a comma
          </li>
          <li>
            Class attributes are used when we would like to apply styling to
            certain elements, but not all elements of the same type
          </li>
          <li>
            Class attributes are then used as CSS selectors so that we can
            assign properties to them

            Javascropt file must be linked to html file, similarly to CSS, but

            <li>
              Link is placed on the line directly above the closing body element
              - this is to ensure that the html is able to load on the page

            Variables: Containers that store values, declared by the word let
            followed by the intended variable's name
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Variable names usually start with a letter, underscore, or dollar
              sign
            </li>
            <li>
              Numbers can be used after the starting character (Ex. temp99)
            </li>
            <li>
              JS is case sensitive, so A-Z and a-z can also be used and will be
              considered unique

          </li>
          <li>
            Naming and declaring variables are not the same thing and can be
            accomplished on one line by typing: let (declaration) myVariable
            (variable name) = "value of variable" (assigns value to variable)
          </li>
          <li>Variables are retrieved by calling the variable name</li>
          <li>
            Variable names can be changed later in the code by typing:

            </li>
            <li>
              Number: A number (obviously). Numbers do not have quotes around
              them
            </li>
            <li>
              Boolean: true/false value. True and false are special values and
              do not need quotes
            </li>
            <li>
              Array: a structure that allows multiple values to be stored in a
              single reference

              <li>Example: let myVariable = [1, 'Bob', 'Steve', 10]</li>
              <li>
                Members of arrays are referred to by number, starting with 0.
                Example: myVariable[0] would return the value 1
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
              Object: This can be anything. Everything in JS is an object and

            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            Operators: mathematical symbols that produce a result based on two
            values (or variables)

            <li>Addition (+): add two numbers or combine two strings</li>

              Subtraction, Multiplication, Division (-, *, /): Do basic math
            </li>
            <li>Assignment (=): Assigns a value to a variable</li>
            <li>
              Strict Equality (===): Performs a test to see if two values are
              equal and returns a boolean result
            </li>
            <li>
              Not, Does-not-equal (!, !==): (!) Returns the logically opposite
              value of what it precedes, like turning true into false. (!==)
              Tests whether two values are not equal
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            Conditionals: code structure that tests if an expression returns
            true or not, commonly if...else
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>

              ("text"); }
            </li>
            <li>
              The expression inside the if() is the test and uses the equality
              operator to compare the variableName with the variableValue to see
              if they are equal

              Return statement tells the browser to return the result variable
