            The head element contains information about the webpage. This

        <h2>CSS</h2>

          <li>CSS = Cascading Style Sheets</li>
          <li>
            Defines colors, aesthestics, visual layout, and organization of a
            webpage
          </li>
          <li>
            Inline CSS is used when a developer wants to style an element
            directly in the HTML file
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>Useful for quick and permanent changes</li>
            <li>
              Applied to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS
              rule
            </li>
            <li>
              Each inline style must be edited individually whenever there is a
              design change
            </li>
            <li>Example: [h1 style="color:red;"] Prework Study Guide[/h1]</li>

          <li>Internal CSS style sheet</li>
          <ul>
            <li>CSS style sheet embedded directly in the HTML file</li>
            <li>Use a [style] element in the [head] element</li>
            <li>Rules apply to that page only</li>
            <li>
              Classes and ids are used to identify elements and style multiple
              elements in the page code
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>External CSS style sheet</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Most common way to style a webpage</li>
            <li>
              Preferred because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules
              in a separate file, making design changes easier
            </li>
            <li>
              To use, the external style sheet is linked in the HTML's head

          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Selector defines the element or attributes to which the
              declarations will apply
            </li>
            <li>
              Declarations contain the CSS property we want to apply and the
              value of that property
            </li>
            <li>
              Two or more declarations in a row is called a declaration block
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            The margin property dictates how much space we want around the
            *outside* of an element.
          </li>
          <li>
            The padding property adds space around the content *inside* an
            element. If padding is increased, the size of the entire element is
            increased.
          </li>
          <li>Consider every HTML element like a box</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              CSS box model - each box (element) consists of margins outside the
              element, and the element's borders, padding, and content.
            </li>
            <li>Content, padding, and border are *inside* the element.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            The * (wild card symbol) can be used as a selector to apply a rule
            to ALL elements on a page.
          </li>
          <li>
            Two selectors can be combined into a single CSS rule with a comma
          </li>
          <li>
            Class attributes are used when we would like to apply styling to
            certain elements, but not all elements of the same type
          </li>
          <li>
            Class attributes are then used as CSS selectors so that we can
            assign properties to them

            Javascript is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows

          </li>
          <li>
            Javascropt file must be linked to html file, similarly to CSS, but

          <ul>
            <li>
              Link is placed on the line directly above the closing body element
              - this is to ensure that the html is able to load on the page

            Variables: Containers that store values, declared by the word let
            followed by the intended variable's name
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Variable names usually start with a letter, underscore, or dollar
              sign
            </li>
            <li>
              Numbers can be used after the starting character (Ex. temp99)
            </li>
            <li>
              JS is case sensitive, so A-Z and a-z can also be used and will be
              considered unique
            </li>

          <li>
            Semicolons are the end of a line indicates where the statement ends
          </li>
          <li>
            Naming and declaring variables are not the same thing and can be
            accomplished on one line by typing: let (declaration) myVariable
            (variable name) = "value of variable" (assigns value to variable)
          </li>
          <li>Variables are retrieved by calling the variable name</li>
          <li>
            Variable names can be changed later in the code by typing:

            </li>
            <li>
              Number: A number (obviously). Numbers do not have quotes around
              them
            </li>
            <li>
              Boolean: true/false value. True and false are special values and
              do not need quotes
            </li>
            <li>
              Array: a structure that allows multiple values to be stored in a
              single reference
            </li>

              <li>Example: let myVariable = [1, 'Bob', 'Steve', 10]</li>
              <li>
                Members of arrays are referred to by number, starting with 0.
                Example: myVariable[0] would return the value 1
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
              Object: This can be anything. Everything in JS is an object and
              can be stored in a variable
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            Operators: mathematical symbols that produce a result based on two
            values (or variables)
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>Addition (+): add two numbers or combine two strings</li>
            <li>
              Subtraction, Multiplication, Division (-, *, /): Do basic math
            </li>
            <li>Assignment (=): Assigns a value to a variable</li>
            <li>
              Strict Equality (===): Performs a test to see if two values are
              equal and returns a boolean result
            </li>
            <li>
              Not, Does-not-equal (!, !==): (!) Returns the logically opposite
              value of what it precedes, like turning true into false. (!==)
              Tests whether two values are not equal
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            Conditionals: code structure that tests if an expression returns
            true or not, commonly if...else
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              if(variableName === "value") { alert ("text"); } else { alert
              ("text"); }
            </li>
            <li>
              The expression inside the if() is the test and uses the equality
              operator to compare the variableName with the variableValue to see
              if they are equal

            Functions: a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse

            <li>
              Return statement tells the browser to return the result variable
              out of the function so it is available to use. Variables defined
              inside functions are ONLY available inside those functions

            <li>
              Event handlers are code structures that listen for activity in the
              browser, and run code in response
            </li>
            <li>
              Example: click event - this event is fired by the browser when you
              click on something with your mouse
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                document.querySelector("button").addEventListener("click",
                function() { alert("Ouch! Stop poking me!"); });
              </li>
              <li>
                In this statement, the button element is selected.
                addEventListener function adds an event to listen for, in this
                case, click. Then, a function to run when the event happens is
                added. In this case, the alert
              </li>
              <li>
                If a function that is passed to addEventListener() has no name,
                it is an anonymous function. Can also be written as:
              </li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  document.querySelector("button").addEventListener("click", ()
                  => { alert("Ouch! Stop poking me!"); });
                </li>

          <li>Web Storage API</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              locaStorage.setItem(value, variable); - this saves the data in the
              browser to be retrieved later
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            Null is a special value in JS that refers to the
