# Coding Bootcamp Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage was developed to serve both as hands-on practice of the HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Git concepts that I was learning as well as to provide a study guide for future reference and increased retention of the information presented.

This project reinforced my prior knowledge of HTML and CSS as well as introduced me to new concepts in JavaScript. I also learned how to better utilize git and github, developing good habits for version control.
